### EstateCrawler --- A simple Java application to scrape house data from xxxx.com

This project is inspired by both COMP3111 project in HKUST and my difficult house searching life in CMU. Besides, COVID-19 makes life even more difficult. 

Hopefully, this application can save me much time from manually searching and sending emails.

xxxx is hidden in the code. :smirk:
